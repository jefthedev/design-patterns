<h1>Structural Patterns</h1>
They are patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in <b>design problems</b> or added complexity to the design. All creational patterns define best possible way in which an object can be created considering <b>reuse</b> and <b>changeability</b>. These describes the best way to handle instantiation. Hard coding the actual instantiation is a pitfall and should be avoided if reuse and changeability are desired. In such scenarios, we can make use of patterns to give this a more general and flexible approach.
