<h1>Behavioral Patterns</h1>
"In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify <b>commom communication</b> patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication." They focuses on the interactions between cooperating objects. These interactions should be such that they are communicating while maintaining as <b>loose coupling</b> as possible. The loose coupling is the key to n-tier architectures. In this, the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order to avoid <b>hard-coding</b> and dependencies.
