<h1>Structural Patterns</h1>
"In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities". They describe how objects and classes can be combined to form structures. We distinguish between object patterns and class patterns. The difference is that class patterns describe relationships and structures with the help of <b>inheritance</b>. Object patterns, on other hand, describe how objects can be <b>associated</b> and <b>aggregated</b> to form larger, more complex structures.
